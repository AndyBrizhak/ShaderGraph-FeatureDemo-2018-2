# Shader Graph Updates and Sample Project

**Read the official [Blog Post](https://blogs.unity3d.com/?p=70662/)**

**This Project is intended to work Unity release [2018.2](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/update).**

This demo Project showcases some of the new features introducted in the Shadergraph tool in 2018.2. 
It uses ShaderGraph to create a foliage focused scene, refer to the in project Readme for links to documentation about the tools used.

In this project you will find sample graphs for great looking foliage and environment shaders, as well as a possible technique for switching between two render pipelines. 
On the Readme inspector, you’ll find buttons that switch between Lightweight and High Definition Render Pipelines. 
This is mainly to allow you to author assets and test compatibility between pipelines -- for production, we recommend using only one render pipeline.

Note: This project demos multiple features that are still in Preview, which means they introduce brand new features and workflows. 
As such, some of these features may be subject to change (API, UX, scope, etc.) and aren’t covered by traditional Unity support. 
You can report issues with Preview features on our [forum](https://forum.unity.com/forums/graphics-experimental-previews.110/?_ga=2.75910933.1446511377.1522795261-1647295365.1509665782) page.

This demo was built by Alex Lindman, Unity Graphic's Tech Art Intern.
